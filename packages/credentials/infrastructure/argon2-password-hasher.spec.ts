/**
 * Most tests here use deliberately weak parameters. Hashing at OWASP defaults
 * takes ~50–100ms by design, and a suite doing it dozens of times would take
 * long enough that people start skipping it — which costs more safety than
 * the stronger test parameters buy.
 *
 * The properties under test (round-trip, rejection, salting, upgrade
 * detection) are independent of cost. The one test that genuinely needs real
 * parameters — that the KDF is actually slow — uses them explicitly.
