 * verification endpoint that says "no account with that address" is an
 * enumeration oracle with no password guessing required at all, which makes
 * it a *cheaper* oracle than the login form.
 *
 * The thing that makes this testable rather than merely asserted is
 * {@link RequestEmailVerificationResult.issued}: the response is identical
