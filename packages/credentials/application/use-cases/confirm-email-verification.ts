/**
 * Redeems a verification link, moving the user from `pending` to `active`.
 *
 * ## Why this one *does* say what went wrong
 *
 * Every other failure path in this package returns a single opaque error.
 * This one distinguishes "expired", "already used" and "not a token we
 * issued", and that is a considered difference rather than an inconsistency.
 *
 * Enumeration resistance protects a secret the attacker is *trying to
 * discover*: which addresses have accounts. Reaching this use case requires
 * already holding a 256-bit token, which is not guessable and which only
 * arrives by controlling the mailbox. There is nothing left to disclose — and
 * "this link expired" is genuinely useful, because the fix ("request another
 * one") is different from the fix for "already used" ("you are already
 * verified; just sign in").
 *
 * Copying the login rule here would produce a worse product for no security
 * gain, which is the failure mode of applying a good principle without its
 * reason.
 *
 * ## The rule that still applies
 *
 * An unknown token is reported identically to an expired one. That one *is* a
 * guess, so it gets nothing back.
