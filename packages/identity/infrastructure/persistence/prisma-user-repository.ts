 * than merely similar.
 *
 * Takes a `PrismaClient` rather than constructing one. That's what lets a
 * caller hand it a transaction client instead (`prisma.$transaction(tx =>
 * ...)`), which Issue 048 relies on for multi-aggregate atomicity — a
 * repository that owned its own connection could never participate in
 * someone else's transaction.
