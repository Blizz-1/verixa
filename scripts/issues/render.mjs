/**
 * Renders a parsed roadmap entry into a GitHub issue body.
 *
 * ## What this is optimising for
 *
 * A contributor who has never seen this codebase should be able to open one
 * issue and start work without asking a question first. That is the bar, and
 * it is a higher bar than "the task is described".
 *
 * Concretely, every issue answers four things the roadmap alone does not:
 *
 * 1. **Where does this sit?** — the phase context, and what already exists
 *    that this builds on.
 * 2. **What should I copy?** — a real file in the repository that solves the
 *    same shape of problem. This codebase is deliberately repetitive, so
 *    there is almost always a pattern to follow, and pointing at it converts
 *    a blank page into a diff.
 * 3. **When am I done?** — a checklist, not a paragraph.
 * 4. **What should I NOT do?** — scope boundaries, which is the section that
 *    prevents the 900-line pull request nobody can review.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not do
 *
 * It does not pad. The long exploratory format that suits an integration
 * spike — where the central question is "does this even work" — would be
 * noise on "add a use case following the existing pattern". Length here
 * tracks genuine uncertainty, and most of these issues are not uncertain.
