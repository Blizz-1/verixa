/**
 * Verifies the query patterns from Phases 02–03 use indexes rather than
 * sequential scans (Issue 055).
 *
 * ## Why this seeds thousands of rows
 *
 * On a small table, a sequential scan is genuinely *faster* than an index
 * scan, and Postgres will correctly choose one — reading 3 rows from a single
 * heap page beats descending a B-tree and then visiting the heap anyway. So
 * asserting "index scan" against the 3-row dev seed would fail, and the
 * obvious fix (forcing the planner with `enable_seqscan = off`) would only
 * prove Postgres obeys orders, not that the index is usable or that the
 * planner would ever pick it.
 *
 * Seeding past the point where a scan stops being cheap is what makes the
 * assertion mean something: the planner is choosing the index freely, the way
 * it would in production.
 *
 * The corollary is worth stating because it is where this kind of test
 * usually goes wrong: **a sequential scan is not a bug.** It is the right
 * plan on small tables, and on large ones when a query genuinely touches most
 * rows. What this test catches is the case where an index that *should*
 * exist doesn't — a lookup by a selective key falling back to a full scan.
